# School Bus Route Optimization Project

## Overview
This project aims to optimize school bus routes using Python. It calculates the most efficient paths for buses using graph theory and visualizes the routes on a map.

## Installation
Install required libraries with: `pip install streamlit folium networkx`

## Usage
Run the Streamlit application with: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

## Data
The `data.json` file contains sample coordinates for bus stops. Modify this file to change the routes.

## Modules
- `optimal_path.py`: Contains functions to find the optimal path.
- `map_visualization.py`: Functions to visualize the route on a map.
- `streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit application for interactive visualization.
